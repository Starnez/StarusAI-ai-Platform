September 7 - 4:25AM
this is my first every real github project. I kind of just jumped in yesterday an im addictewd already.
Ive been spending coutnless hours at my desk coding, and the time just flies by. I dont even realize it. 
TYesterday i spent most of the time trying to figure out how margins truly work. does positive top 
mean closer or further away from the top? Who knows, at this point im just entering numbers and hoping
for the best. Today ive been at this desk for hours trying to get this login working on the app and 
its finally functional. and pretty secure i bleieve. oh well id imagine i got some time to up security. 
tomorrow i plan on finishing the admin console so i can begin to add users. Before that though i need to
finsih the content generation page. Anyway it 430am and im going to sleep. This is fun im having fun.

Well here we are again anbother day of Creating greatness in the books. I think yesterday was the hardest
day. Trying to get the login to work correctly was harder than a pope at kindergarten. Seriously, today 
was a lot eawsier. Coding the Admin console wasnt as difficult as a beleived it would be, but now I can
add users to the site manually, which is how i want it to start, eventually users will be able to log
themselves in. The most important is that the content generator works! and works great! I will add some
Tweaks to it but nonetheless as of right now the app is definetly functionable and impressive. I would
have no problem showing this to some companies!

# StarusAI-ai-Platform

Septermber 7 - 4:25pm 
this is my first every real github project. I kind of just jumped in yesterday an im addictewd already.
Ive been spending coutnless hours at my desk coding, and the time just flies by. I dont even realize it. 
TYesterday i spent most of the time trying to figure out how margins truly work. does positive top 
mean closer or further away from the top? Who knows, at this point im just entering numbers and hoping
for the best. Today ive been at this desk for hours trying to get this login working on the app and 
its finally functional. and pretty secure i bleieve. oh well id imagine i got some time to up security. 
tomorrow i plan on finishing the admin console so i can begin to add users. Before that though i need to
finsih the content generation page. Anyway it 430am and im going to sleep. This is fun im having fun.
